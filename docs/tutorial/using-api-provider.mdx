# Using API Provider

The API provider component comes with a bunch of props which is used to configure the setup for the developers.

## Props

```jsx
<ApiProvider
apiArray={...defining array of query objects}
baseQuery={baseQuery}
logging={flag to log all the api actions and payload for debugging}
 />
```

## Usage

- `apiArray`: This is an array of object used to define all your API calls.

  The shape of the objects in queryArrray is as follows:

```
    apiArray: Array<{
    name: string,
    query: string,
    method: "GET" | "POST" | "PUT" | "DELETE" | "PATCH",
    type: "query" | "mutation",
    }>
```

### Example for apiArray

```jsx
import { ApiProvider } from "hardtail";
<ApiProvider
  apiArray={[
    {
      // highlight-start
      name: "getAllPost",
      // highlight-end
      query: "/posts",
      type: "query",
      method: "GET",
    },
    ...rest,
  ]}
/>;
```

:::tip Note

While writing the name field of your query object ,make sure you use the unique name for each object.
:::

- `baseQuery`: This props is used to define the baseQuery for you api endpoint and for defining the same we use `fetchBaseQuery` function which ships with the library.

### Example for baseQuery

Defining the baseQuery

```jsx
const baseQuery = fetchBaseQuery({
  baseUrl: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com",
  headers: {
    "Content-type": "application/json; charset=UTF-8",
  },
});
```

Using in the api Provider

```jsx
<ApiProvider baseQuery={baseQuery} />
```

- `logging`: This props is used for logging all the api actionand payload in order to debug. To use the log feature you can simply pass a `log` string and it will do the job.

### Example for logging

Using in the api Provider

```jsx
<ApiProvider logging="log" />
```

:::tip Note

After adding all the props value properly it will look like this
:::

```jsx
<ApiProvider apiArray={yourApiArray} baseQuery={yourBaseQuery} logging="log" />
```

### Useful Tips

Some useful tips
:::

As we know that in some backend when we call any update,delete or creation endpoint it does the following things

1. **Case 1 :** It either give back the resource which is updated,deleted or created

2. **Case 2 :** Or it give back the updated resource after editing , updating or deletion.

Now lets take an example to understand this. Suppose we have a `note` resource in our backend which has the following endpoint

- getOne
- getMany
- updateOne
- deleteOne
- createOne

If the api on mutation return only the updated,deleted,or updated resource and not all the resource back you have to sync in yourself and that's common.

However if your api return all the resource after update,delete,or create then you can do one interesting thing to sync your UI with the server state.

What you can do is just pass a tag key with the resource name on which in our case is `notes` and all you get,update,delete and create will sync with only one state that is `notes`;
