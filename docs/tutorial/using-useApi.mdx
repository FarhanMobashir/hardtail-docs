# Using useApi

The library also ships with a `useApi` hook which will consume the ApiProvider.

## How this works

When we fill all the props with the correct value we get a react hook for every query object we have defined in the query array.

- If the query object has a `type:"query"` then we get a hook which will fetch the data for us and also gives us error and loading state
- If the query object we have has a `type:mutation` then we we get a tuple where the first element is a function to call the api and post , or update , or delete something. We also we an object with the loading , error state and response came back from the api.
- It makes the name of the api by prefixing the api action types with `use` and camel casing the api action types. For example if the apiActionType is `getAllPost` it will be converted to `useGetAllPost`

## Usage

```jsx
const { state, useGetAllPost } = useApi();
```

- Here the state is the global Api state that is formed with the name value you passed in the queryArray.

```jsx
const { state, useGetAllPost } = useApi();

<>
  {state.getAllPosts.map((item) => (
    <div>{item.name}</div>
  ))}
</>;
```
